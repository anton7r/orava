# Orava

Orava is a database client library that aims to make querying PostgreSQL and MySQL databases easier building on top of already existing technologies such as scany.

The word 'orava' comes from the Finnish language and means squirrel and the project name is not final.

## The library still needs heavylifting before it can utilized in production environments

The api of the library is likely to change until v1.0.0 is reached, thank you for your patience.

In the meantime you can provide feature requests and api revisions which are highly appreciated.
